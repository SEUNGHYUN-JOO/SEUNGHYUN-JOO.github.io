## 🔍 Project Overview: Integrated M&S Development
[cite_start]This project aims to secure an integrated Modeling & Simulation (M&S) environment required for the development of **next-generation high-speed, long-range rotorcraft**[cite: 123]. [cite_start]The focus was on building a high-performance computational framework and specialized analysis modules for unconventional rotorcraft configurations[cite: 124, 131].

## 🛠️ Key Technical Contributions

### 1. High-Performance Python-C++ Interface & Wrapper
* [cite_start]**Motivation:** Overcoming the computational overhead of pure Python while maintaining its high versatility and intuitive structure[cite: 127].
* [cite_start]**Implementation:** Developed a **C++ based aerodynamic analysis core** and integrated it with Python via a custom **Interface and Wrapper**[cite: 128].
* [cite_start]**Efficiency:** Achieved high-speed computational performance while preserving an **object-oriented modeling environment**, enabling rapid design iterations.

### 2. Coaxial Rotor Aerodynamic Module (RISPECT III)
* [cite_start]**Module Development:** Developed and validated a **Coaxial Blade Element Theory (BET)** aerodynamic module within the **RISPECT III** module in AMADEVS framework[cite: 125].
* [cite_start]**Validation:** Verified the analysis accuracy by comparing results with **XH-59A flight test data** and other established codes (e.g., RCAS)[cite: 176, 178, 181].

### 3. Sizing & Multidisciplinary Optimization
* [cite_start]**Configuration Comparison:** Conducted sizing and optimization for candidate platforms, specifically comparing **Tilt-Rotor** and **Coaxial-Pusher** configurations[cite: 131, 228].
* [cite_start]**Mission-based Analysis:** Performed performance evaluations under various operational scenarios, including **High-speed Infiltration (Scenario A)** and **Medical Evacuation (Scenario B)**[cite: 149, 164].
* [cite_start]**Weight & Power Analysis:** Derived trade-offs between required power, fuel consumption, and group weight (structure, propulsion, etc.) for each configuration[cite: 135, 166, 226].
