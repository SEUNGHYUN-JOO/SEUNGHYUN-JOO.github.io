## 🔍 Project Overview
Investigated the complex aerodynamic interference of eVTOL aircraft during hover and near-ground operations to address the inadequacy of current vertiport safety standards.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Contributions
* **Solver Validation:** Verified the fidelity of **SIMULIA PowerFLOW (LBM)** by comparing results against experimental data of the CH-47D tandem rotor and Joby S4 eVTOL.
* **Multi-Configuration Analysis:** Performed high-fidelity simulations for representative NASA UAM reference vehicles:
    * **Configurations:** Quiet Single Main Rotor (QSMR), Side-by-Side (SbS), Quadrotor, and Lift+Cruise (LPC).
    * **Findings:** Identified that eVTOLs generate more turbulent and directionally concentrated outwash compared to legacy helicopters, with the LPC configuration producing the largest hazard footprint.
* **Environmental Impact Study:** Analyzed the influence of wind conditions (forward/diagonal), discovering that headwinds significantly intensify rotor-rotor interference and extend hazard zones up to 3x the regulatory limit.
