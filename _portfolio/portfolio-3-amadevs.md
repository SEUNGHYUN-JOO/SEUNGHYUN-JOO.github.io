## 🚀 Project Overview: AMADEVS
This project introduces **AMADEVS** (Advanced Modeling, Analysis & Design Environment for Vehicle Systems), a generalized framework developed at AVDL, SNU, to support the multidisciplinary design and analysis of unconventional aircraft configurations (eVTOL, UAM, etc.). 

The framework enables integrated workflows for aerodynamics, propulsion, and flight dynamics on a unified aircraft model. [Related Publication: AIAA 2026-1687]

### 🛠️ My Key Contributions

#### 1. Development of Unsteady VLM Code (Free-wake based)
* **Aerodynamics:** Developed a **Free-wake based Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (UVLM)** code from scratch.
* **Versatile Analysis:** The code is capable of high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis for both **rotors and fixed-wings**, capturing complex wake-induced effects.
* **Interaction Modeling:** Specifically implemented modules to analyze **Propeller-Wing Interaction (PWI)**, a critical factor in distributed electric propulsion (DEP) systems.

#### 2. Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)
* **Wing Planform Optimization:** Conducted wing planform optimization by considering the coupling between aerodynamics and structural constraints.

### Key Focus Areas:
* **Optimization Results:** Showing the trade-off between aerodynamic efficiency and structural weight in wing design.
